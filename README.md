## Project Specs:
See `.python-version` file for python version (don't trust this here, but supposedly `3.11.2` at the time of writing)
To see dependencies, look at `requirements.txt`. This can be installed into your virtual environment 
using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (after activating the virtual environment).
